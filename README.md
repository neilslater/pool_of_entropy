# PoolOfEntropy

PoolOfEntropy is a PRNG based on cryptographic secure PRNGs, intended to bring back the feeling of
'personal luck' that some gamers may feel when rolling their *own* dice. An instance of the
PoolOfEntropy class could be assigned to a player, or to each die in a game, and it can be
influenced (similar to throwing a die differently), or personalised by feeding in arbitrary data
(e.g. a picture of the player, a favourite saying). It can support these influences whilst
remaining unbiased and fair on each roll.
